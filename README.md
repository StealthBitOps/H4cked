#### 🧭 Objectives
- Investigate a compromised web server and identify the attack vector.
- Apply forensic techniques to uncover malicious activity.
- Practise real-world incident response and recovery.

#### 🧠 Skills Explored
- Log analysis and timeline reconstruction.
- Identifying web-based exploits and backdoors.
- Manual enumeration and privilege escalation.
- File system investigation and attacker tracing.

#### 🛠️ Tools Overview
- `cat`, `grep`, `less` – for log and file inspection.
- `LinPEAS`, `sudo`, `find`, `whoami` – for privilege escalation and enumeration.
- TryHackMe forensic VM – compromised machine for analysis.

#### 🔄 Steps to Remember (_Incident Response Flow_)
1. **Initial Access** – Review logs and suspicious activity.
2. **Enumeration** – Identify attacker foothold and system changes.
3. **Privilege Escalation** – Discover elevated access paths.
4. **Persistence & Payloads** – Locate backdoors and scripts.
5. **Remediation** – Clean up and document findings.
